# Combat Options

## Melee Strikes
These combat actions can be used as part of a melee weapon attack or replaces one.

### Disarm
A creature can use a weapon attack to knock a weapon or another item from a target's grasp. The attacker makes an attack roll contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) check or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If the attacker wins the contest, the attack causes no damage or other ill effect, but the defender drops the item.

The attacker has disadvantage on its attack roll if the target is holding the item with two or more hands. The target has advantage on its ability check if it is larger than the attacking creature, or disadvantage if it is smaller.

### Shoving and Tripping
Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature to push it away from you, or to trip a creature to knock it prone. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.

The target of your shove or trip must be no more than one size larger than you, and it must be within your reach. You make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target’s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you win the contest, you either shove the target 5 feet away from you or trip it prone.

### Coup de Grace 
When you make an attack that qualifies as an automatic critical hit against a defenceless target, roll a regular Attack roll. The target may not add their Dexterity bonus to its AC. If you hit, the creature takes damage equal to the total of its current hit points and is dying. If you do not hit, the creature instead loses half its current hit points. If your attack roll would have critically hit a normal target, the creature dies immediately.

### Dirty Fighting  (Free Hand)
Dirty fighting is a catch-all name for many socially rejected grappling techniques that exploit the opponent.

If you have Advantage on an attack against a target, you can change that attack into a dirty move from the list below. Make a Strength (Athletics) check vs your target's passive Strength (Athletics) score. If you fail, you provoke an attack of opportunity from your opponent. If you succeed, apply the dirty move effect.

- **Restrain.** The target is grappled and restrained by you.
- **Headlock.** The target is grappled by you and suffocating (Player's Handbook, pg. 183) until the grapple is broken.
- **Eyejab.** The target is Blinded until the end of its next turn. You may also Shove the creature as part of the Dirty Trick, but at disadvantage.
- **Groin shot.** The target is Stunned until the end of its next turn. You may also Shove the creature as part of the Dirty Trick, but at disadvantage.

Once you use a dirty move against a target, you cannot succeed with the same trick again until end of combat.

### Mark
When a creature makes a melee attack, it can also mark its target. Until the end of the attacker's next turn, any opportunity attack it makes against the marked target has advantage. The opportunity attack doesn't expend the attacker's reaction, but the attacker can't make the attack if anything, such as the incapacitated condition or the shocking grasp spell, is preventing it from taking reactions. The attacker is limited to one opportunity attack per turn.

### Power Attack  
Before you make an attack with a melee weapon using your Strength modifier, you can choose to suffer disadvantage on the attack roll and attempt to put more of your raw strength behind a powerful blow.

If the attack hits, you add double your Strength modifier (minimum 1) to the attack's damage. If you are attacking using a weapon wielded in two hands, you instead triple your Strength modifier.

## Ranged Options

### Aim
If your target hasn't moved during its previous turn, you can spend your movement to stand still, hold your breath and aim with a ranged weapon. Until the end of this turn, each ranged attack against that target has advantage.

While aiming you are considered concentrating, if damage taken or an effect would break your concentration, you no longer have advantage on ranged weapon attacks.

## Melee Reactions

### Counter  
When a creature misses you with a melee attack by 10 or more, you may use your reaction to perform a single melee attack against that creature. You cannot Counter while using the Dodge action.

## Movement Actions

### Charge   
When you move at least 20 feet towards a target, you may declare a charge attack as an action. You must have a clear path towards your target, and nothing should hinder your path (such as difficult terrain or obstacles). If you finish your movement within reach of your target, you may use your action to follow it with one of these options:

- **Strike.** You may make a single melee attack with advantage. The attack deals additional damage equal to the distance you charged divided by 5, up to your Strength or Constitution modifier (your choice, minimum of 1). If you are riding a mounted animal that provides the movement instead of you, you must use its Strength or Constitution instead your own.
- **Slam.** You may perform the Shove action (Player's Handbook, pg. 195) with advantage. If you succeed, the creature is shoved twice the normal distance, or shoved as normal then knocked prone. You may choose to move up to five feet in the direction you are shoving your target. If you fail, you provoke an attack of opportunity from your target.
- **Tackle.** You may make a single Grapple attempt with advantage. If the Grapple fails, you provoke an attack of opportunity from your target and are knocked prone. If you succeed, both you and your opponent are knocked prone and your target is subjected to the Grappled condition.

## Additional Actions

### Climb onto a Bigger Creature
If one creature wants to jump onto another creature, it can do so by grappling. A small or Medium creature has little chance of making a successful grapple against a Huge or Gargantuan creature, however, unless magic has granted the grappler supernatural might. As an alternative, a suitably large opponent can be treated as terrain for the purpose of jumping onto its back or clinging to a limb. 

After making any ability checks necessary to get into position and onto the larger creature, the smaller creature uses its action to make a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by the target's Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If it wins the contest, the smaller creature successfully moves into the target creature's space, the smaller creature moves with the target and has advantage on attack rolls against it.

The smaller creature can move around within the larger creature's space, treating the space as difficult terrain. The larger creature's ability to attack the smaller creature depends on the smaller creature's location, and is left to your discretion. The larger creature can dislodge the smaller creature as an action—knocking it off, scraping it against a wall, or grabbing and throwing it—by making a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the smaller creature's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. The smaller creature chooses which ability to use.

### Guard
You can defend an ally within 5 feet of you. When you take the Guard action, you focus entirely on preventing attacks from reaching your ally. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against the guarded ally has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, as long as the ally is within 5 feet of you.

Additionally, if an attack would hit the guarded ally, you can instead have it hit you (no action required). If you do so, the attacker chooses the maximum amount of damage instead of rolling.

### Overrun
When a creature tries to move through a hostile creature's space, the mover can try to force its way through by overrunning the hostile creature. As an action or a bonus action, the mover makes a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the hostile creature's Strength (Athletics) check. The creature attempting the overrun has advantage on this check if it is larger than the hostile creature, or disadvantage if it is smaller. If the mover wins the contest, it can move through the hostile creature's space once this turn.

### Tumble
A creature can try to tumble through a hostile creature's space, ducking and weaving past the opponent. As an action or a bonus action, the tumbler makes a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by the hostile creature's Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. If the tumbler wins the contest, it can move through the hostile creature's space once this turn.
