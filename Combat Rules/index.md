# Combat Rules


## Unarmed Stikes Attacks
Unarmed strikes, be they punches, kicks, head-butts, or any similar forceful blow, count as weapons for features and spells that require them.

## Called Shots
Often times, in combat, characters might want to target a specific body part or feature of their target when making an attack. This is commonly referred to as a “called shot.” If this is a mechanic you want to implement in your game, consider using the following variant rule.

### Calling a Shot
In order to make a called shot, you must first be making an attack roll with advantage. If you want to turn that attack into a called shot, you can choose to do so by forgoing that advantage. If you do so, and the attack hits, the hit becomes a called shot.

When you hit with a called shot, you can choose to deal normal weapon damage and then roll a d100 to determine the effect of the shot randomly using the Called Shot Effects table below. Alternatively, you can choose to roll your damage dice twice and take the lesser total. If you do so, you can choose the effect you want to cause on the Called Shot Effects table below, instead of determining it randomly.

**Called Shot Effects**
| d100  | Effect |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  01-45  | **Leg Shot.** The creature gains 1 slowed level until the end of its next turn. |
|  46-90  | **Arm Shot.** The creature can not use an arm until the end of its next turn. If the creature has multiple arms, determine which arm is affected randomly. |
|  91-95  | **Scatter Shot.** If the creature attempts to cast a power before the end of its next turn, it must first make a concentration check (DC = 10 + the power’s level). On a failure, any resources are spent and the power immediately fails. |
|  96-100  | **Head Shot.** The creature is blinded until the start of its next turn. |


## Cleaving Through Creatures
When a melee attack reduces an undamaged creature to 0 hit points, any excess damage from that attack might carry over to another creature nearby. The attacker targets another creature within reach and, if the original attack roll can hit it, applies any remaining damage to it. 

If that creature was undamaged and is likewise reduced to 0 hit points, repeat this process, carrying over the remaining damage until there are no valid targets, or until the damage carried over fails to reduce an undamaged creature to 0 hit points.

## Death's Door
When an unconscious creature with 0 hit points regains one hit point or more and regains consciousness, they gain one level of exhaustion until they finish a short rest or long rest. If a creature gained multiple levels of exhaustion in this way, a short rest can only recover one level of exhaustion.

## Flanking
When a creature and at least one of its allies are adjacent to an enemy and on opposite sides or corners of the enemy's space, they flank that enemy, and each of them has advantage on melee attack rolls against that enemy.

When in doubt about whether two creatures flank an enemy on a grid, trace an imaginary line between the centers of the creatures' spaces. If the line passes through opposite sides or corners of the enemy's space, the enemy is flanked.

### Reach
A creature who has a reach of greater than 5 feet gains the benefit of flanking against a creature while within melee range, but does not contribute towards flanking unless they are within 5 feet of the target. 

Example: there is a Paladin wielding a halberd and a Fighter wielding a sword and shield fighting an orc. The Paladin is standing 10 feet away from the orc while the Fighter is standing adjacent to the opposite side of the orc. The Paladin gains Advantage with attacks using their halberd because the Fighter is within 5 feet of the orc, however because the Paladin is not within 5 feet of the orc, the Fighter does not gain Advantage on their attacks.

## Grappling
When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.

The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you, and it must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check, a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) against a DC of 10 plus the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) modifier (the target chooses the ability to use). If your target is smaller than you, you have advantage. If the target is larger than you, you have disadvantage. If you succeed, you subject the target to the grappled condition (see appendix A). The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).

**Escaping a Grapple.** A grappled creature can use one Attack as part of an attack action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check against a DC of 10 plus your Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) modifier (you choose the ability to use).

**Moving a Grappled Creature.** When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.

## Tactical Initiative
Rather than each player character and creature acting on their own, two or more allied creatures can instead choose to act tactically and work together using this initiative variant rule.

#### Rolling Tactical Initiative
When combat begins and initiative would be rolled, two or more allied creatures can choose to work as a unit, provided they can see or hear and understand each other. When they do so, they each roll initiative separately, adding any modifiers as appropriate. Once each individual party has rolled their initiative, the group then acts using the lowest result. Once a tactical group is formed, each character’s initiative is set to the lowest result, even if the tactical group separates.

For instance, if three players want to use tactical initiative, and they roll a 17, an 11, and a 14, all three players will instead act on initiative 11.

#### Multiple Tactical Groups
The party can use multiple tactical groups rather than all working in concert. For instance, a party of five might split into a tactical group of three and a tactical group of two, each group rolling their tactical initiative separately. A character can only belong to one tactical group at a time.

#### Acting in Concert
When a tactical group’s turn comes up in the initiative order, each member of the group acts together. Their turns and actions can come in any order, though each individual tactical group member is still limited to what actions they could normally take. Additionally, actions that could normally be broken up, such as when a fighter takes the Attack action and has the Extra Attack feature, can be broken up during the turn.

For instance, a 5th-level fighter might take the Attack action and make their first attack. Before they make their second attack, however, the operative ally in their tactical group might then take the Help action to grant them advantage before the fighter makes the second attack.

#### Separating a Tactical Group
When a tactical group loses contact with each other, or if the tactical group chooses to break up on their turn (no action required), the tactical group becomes separated. When separated, each member of the former tactical group acts on their own, though they retain the initiative of the tactical group. The order of any active members of the former tactical group acting on the same initiative is determined randomly.
