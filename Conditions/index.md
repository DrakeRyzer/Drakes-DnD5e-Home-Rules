## Conditions

### Grappled
* A grappled creature's speed becomes 0, and it cannot benefit from any bonus to its speed. 
* The condition ends if the Grappler is incapacitated.
* If an effect would remove the grappled creature from the reach of the Grappler or Grappling effect, the Grappler must make a Strength saving throw vs the DC of the effect to hold onto the grappled creature, or the grapple ends.
* Attacks targeting a grappling or grappled creature are at disadvantage, unless a light or natural weapon is used.
* A grappled creature has disadvantage to hit creatures that are not grappling it.
* If you have a Strength of 13 or more, you can spend one of your attacks to make a Grapple check to restrain a creature you are grappling. If you succeed, the creature is Restrained by you. If you fail, the Grapple is broken and the creature can use its reaction to make an opportunity attack against you.

### Restrained
* A restrained creatureâ€™s speed becomes 0, and it cannot benefit from any bonus to its speed.
* Attack rolls against the creature have advantage, and the creature's Attack rolls have disadvantage. The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity saving throws.
* A creature that has been restrained via a Grapple remains Restrained as long as it is also Grappled. If the Grapple breaks, it is no longer Restrained.
* If you have Strength of 13 or more, you can spend one of your attacks to make a Grapple check to Pin a creature you are Restraining. If you succeed the creature is Pinned by you. If you fail, the Grapple is broken and the creature can use its reaction to make an opportunity attack against you.

### Pinned
Pinned creatures are usually pressed against a hard surface, their limbs held in a lock and struggling under body weight. 

* You can Pin creatures of the same size or smaller than you. Creatures larger than you cannot be Pinned.
* A Pinned creature is unable to perform any actions other than an opposed Grapple check to break the grapple, or cast spells and cantrips with verbal components only.
* A Pinned creature does not benefit from Dexterity to AC or Shields, and is a valid target for [Coup de Grace](https://drakeryzer.github.io/Drakes-DnD5e-Home-Rules/Combat%20Rules/Combat%20Options/#coup-de-grace), but with disadvantage.
* At the start of your turn, you must spend one of your attacks to maintain the Pin. If you choose to use it for anything else, the creature is no longer Pinned by you.
* During your turn and as long as you have used one of your attacks to maintain the Pin, you can attempt a Disarm action as a bonus action. 
* A creature remains Pinned as long as it is also Grappled and Restrained. If the Grapple breaks, it is no longer Pinned.
