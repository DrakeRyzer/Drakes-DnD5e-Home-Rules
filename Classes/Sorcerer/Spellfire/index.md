# Sorcerer Subclass

## Spellfire
Your innate magic comes from refining and controling raw magic, often called spellfire. Spellfire energies can be used to heal wounds, project destructive bursts of flame, absorb spells cast upon you, turning them against their caster as well as channeling raw magic into your strikes. It often manifests as a white-hot energy or blue-white flame. 

For a long time, the ability to control spellfire was believed to be unique to a single person each generation, but that was a fallacy: most wielders simply choose to hide their ability in order to avoid getting noticed by powerful organizations such as the Cult of the Dragon.

### Spellfire Refinement
Spellfire: 1st level<br>
You know how to refine raw magic to empower yourself and enhance your attacks, granting the following benefits:

- **Fortitude:** Your hit point maximum increases by 1, and it increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.
- **Resilience:** Your base AC becomes 13 + your Constitution modifier.
- **Discharge:** When you make a melee weapon attack as a part of a spell you cast, you can use Charisma instead of Strength for the attack and damage rolls.
- **Retaliation:** Additionally, when you deal damage with a spell or a melee weapon attack, if you took damage since the start of your last turn, you deal an extra 1d4 damage. The damage is the same type as the power or weapon’s damage.
    - This die increases when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d6 at 6th level to 1d8 at 9th level, to 1d10 at 13th level, and to 1d12 at 17th level.

### Protection of the Weave
Spellfire: 6th level<br>
You learn to channel the raw energies of the Weave around yourself to withstand physical blows. 

As an action, you can gain resistance to bludgeoning, piercing and slashing damage for 1 minute. This effect lasts until you end it as a bonus action, you are incapacitated, or you don armor other than a shield. 

You can use this feature twice and regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.

### Magic Conversion
Spellfire: 10th level<br>
When you take damage from a spell, you can use your reaction and expend a spell slot to regain health equal to 1d8 + your Charisma modifier as long as that damage would not have reduced your hit points to 0.

This die increases when you reach certain levels in this class: to 1d10 at 13th level and to 1d12 at 17th level.

### Unrelenting Resilience
Spellfire: 14th level<br>
When you use your Magic Conversion feature while concentrating on a spell, you can add the amount healed to a Constitution saving throw made to maintain concentration.

Additionally, when you are reduced to 0 hit points but not killed outright while Protection of the Weave is active, you can drop to 1 hit point instead. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

### Spellfire Unleashed
Spellfire: 18th level<br>
As an action, you can choose a point within 60 feet. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of that point must make a Constitution saving throw against your universal force save DC. On a failed save, a creature takes 5d10 force damage and suffers 1 level of exhaustion. On a successful save, a creature takes half damage and does not suffer exhaustion.

For each creature that fails this saving throw, a friendly creature within 30 feet of them can regain hit points equal to the amount of damage dealt. A friendly creature can only gain this benefit once per turn.

You can use this feature six times. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
