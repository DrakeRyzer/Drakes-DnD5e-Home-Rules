# Sorcerer Changes
## Class Features

### Spellcasting
#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
You know a number of sorcerer spells equal to your Charisma modifier + your sorcerer level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

### Metamagic
At 3rd level, you gain the ability to twist your spells to suit your needs. 

You gain two of the following Metamagic options of your choice. You gain one more options at Sorcerer level 9 and two more at Sorcerer level 17.

You can use only one Metamagic option on a spell when you cast it, unless otherwise noted.

### 10th level Sorcerous Origin
> Every Sorcerous Origin gets another feature at 10th level as they normally only get 1 more metamagic as well as 1 cantrip. Which is quite boring and they normally have to wait 8 levels between subclass features. (I still need to add one to everything not listed here)
