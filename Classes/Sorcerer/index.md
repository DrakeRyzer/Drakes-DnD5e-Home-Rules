# Sorcerer Changes
## Class Features

### Spellcasting
#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
You know a number of sorcerer spells equal to your Charisma modifier + your sorcerer level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the sorcerer spells you know and replace it with another spell from the sorcerer spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.
