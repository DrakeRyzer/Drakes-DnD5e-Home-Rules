# Barbarian Subclass
## Path of the Brawler
Most barbarains require weapons to deal significant damage to their enemies. For barbarains of the Path of the Brawler, however, everything is their weapon...including their enemies.

### Brawling Fighting Style
Starting at 3rd level, you learn Brawler Fighting Style. (Listed here as reference)

You are skilled at using your weight to your advantage. You gain the following benefits:
- You are proficient with improvised weapons.
- Your unarmed strike damage increases by one step (from 1 to d4, d4 to d6, or d6 to d8).
- When you take the Attack action and attempt to grapple, shove, or trip a creature, or make an attack against a creature with an unarmed strike or a weapon wielded in one hand on your turn, you can use your bonus action to make an unarmed strike, grapple, shove, or trip against the same creature.

### Reckless Strikes
Starting at 3rd level, while you are raging, not wearing heavy armor and not wielding a shield, when you hit a creature with an unarmed strike or improvised weapon, you can choose to forgo your rage damage to make the attack a reckless strike.

Some of your reckless strikes require your target to make a saving throw to resist the reckless strikeâ€™s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

<center>

**Reckless Strike save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength modifier

</center>

You can use these features a combined number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, as shown in the barbarian table. You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.

#### Bracing Strike
You gain temporary hit points equal to your rage damage bonus. If the target is grappled by you, you instead gain temporary hit points equal to twice your rage damage bonus.
#### Punishing Strike
Your target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is deafened until the start of its next turn. If the target is grappled by you, it is instead incapacitated until the start of its next turn.
#### Staggering Strike
Your target must make a Strength or Dexterity saving throw (the target chooses the ability score to use). On a failed save, your target is pushed back 5 feet. If the target is grappled by you, it is instead knocked prone.

### Shattering Strikes
Starting at 6th level, your rage causes your strikes to overcome the hardest of materials. While raging, you gain the following benefits:
- Your unarmed strikes and improved weapons count as enhanced for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to unenhanced attacks and damage.
- Your unarmed strikes deal double damage against structures.

### Stop Hitting Each Other
Starting at 10th level you gain the following benefits:
- You can grapple creatures two sizes larger than you, instead of one.
- The damage die of your unarmed strike increases by one more size (from d4 to d6, d6 to d8, or d8 to d10).
- You can use creatures you have grappled that are at least one size smaller than you as improvised weapons. When you do so, when you hit with an attack using a creature as a weapon, it takes damage equal to your Strength modifier. While raging, you can instead use creatures your size or smaller as improvised weapons.

### Enforcer
Starting at 14th level, when you would make an unarmed strike or attack with an improvised weapon with advantage, you can choose to forgo the advantage. If you do so, your unarmed strikes score a critical hit on a roll of 18, 19 or 20., and on a hit, you deal maximum damage instead of rolling.
