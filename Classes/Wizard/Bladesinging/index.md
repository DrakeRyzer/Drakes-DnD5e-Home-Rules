# Wizard Subclass

## Bladesinging

### Training in War and Song
You gain proficiency with light armour and you gain proficiency with two one-handed melee weapons of your choice.

You also gain proficiency in the Performance skill. If you are already proficient in it, you instead gain expertise in it.

### Bladesong
You can invoke magic called the Bladesong, provided that you aren't wearing medium or heavy armor or using a shield. It graces you with supernatural speed, agility, and focus.

You can use a bonus action to start the Bladesong, which lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are incapacitated, if you don medium or heavy armor or a shield, or if you use strength to make an attack with a weapon. You can also dismiss the Bladesong at any time (no action required).

While your Bladesong is active, you gain the following benefits:
* You gain a bonus to your AC equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).
* Your walking speed increases by 10 feet.
* You have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks.
* You gain a bonus to any Constitution saving throw you make to maintain your concentration on a spell. The bonus equals your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).

You can use this feature a number of times equal to half your intelligence bonus (round up), and you regain all expended uses of it when you finish a short or long rest.
