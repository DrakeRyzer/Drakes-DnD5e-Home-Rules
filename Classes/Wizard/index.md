# Wizard Changes
## Class Features

### Spellcasting

#### Spellbook
At 1st level, you have a spellbook containing three cantrips and six 1st-level of your choice from the wizard spell list. Your spellbook is the repository of the wizard spells you know.

#### Learning Spells of 1st Level and Higher
Each time you gain a wizard level, you can add two levelled wizard spells of your choice to your spellbook for free. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots, as shown on the Wizard table. You also learn additional wizard cantrips of your choice at higher levels, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Wizard table. On your adventures, you might find other spells that you can add to your spellbook (see Your Spellbook).

#### Your Spellbook
**Copying a Spell into the Book.** When you find a spellbook or spell scroll containing a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a level for which you have spell slots and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it. For each level of the spell, the process takes 1 hour per spell level and costs the amount of gold listed in the table for **Spell Scribing Costs**. The cost represents the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.

**Replacing the Book.** You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another book - for example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You only need to spend 10 minutes for each levei of the copied spell. The material cost is the same.

**Levelling Up.** At level up, a wizard may pay the scribing cost for a spell to add it spell to their spellbook, representing the culmination of investing in additional spell research.

### Archmage
At 20th level, you have mastered the arcane arts. Your Intelligence score increases by 4, and your maximum for this score also increases by 4.
