# Ranger Subclass

## Witcher

### Witcher Alchemy
At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with your choice of the alchemist's, herbalist's or poisoner's kit. If you are already proficient in it, you instead gain expertise.

Once per short rest, you can apply acid to a weapon as a bonus action, which lasts for 1 minute. For the duration, the weapon deals additional acid damage equal to your Wisdom modifier. If you have successfully identified your target creature's type, its damage resistance versus the attacks laced with witcher alchemy is reduced by one step.

You gain one additional use of this acid at levels 7 and 15.

### Witcher Gear
At 3rd level, chainmail is considered medium armour for you, and you may add up to +2 of your Dexterity modifier to your AC while wearing it.

In addition, you can use your Wisdom attribute to make Wisdom (Stealth) checks to use your knowledge of the hunt to stalk your prey. Wisdom (Stealth) checks are not made at disadvantage when wearing chainmail.

Finally, when wielding weapons with the versatile property, you can choose to add your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to your attack and damage rolls.

### Witcher Signs
At 3rd level, the spells in the Witcher Signs table are added to the ranger spell list for you. 

Furthermore, you learn two additional spells of your highest spell level from the Witcher Signs table at 3rd, 5th, 9th, 13th and 17th level. These additional spells don't count against the number of ranger spells you know.
