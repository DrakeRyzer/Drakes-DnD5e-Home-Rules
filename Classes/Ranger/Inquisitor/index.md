# Ranger Subclass

## Inquisitor
Across history, there have been those who live to hunt heretics. Inquisitors combine the arcane with the divine to track down and eliminate mages and cultists. For those practitioners of forbidden power, they are the greatest adversary.

### Whispers of the Arcane
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you have learned secrets from subtle attunement to the arcane. Choose two arcane spells of no higher level than your Max Spell Level, as shown in the ranger class table. The chosen spells count as known ranger spells for you, but are not included in the number in the Spells Known column of the ranger class table. Additionally, you gain the ability to ritual cast.

You learn two additional spells at 5th, 9th, and 13th level. Whenever you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the arcane spells you know and replace it with another arcane spell of no higher level than your Max Spell Level.

### Mark of the Inquisitor
Also at 3rd level, when the target of your Hunter's Mark spell is within 15 feet of you, you gain the following benefits:

* Whenever the creature casts a spell, it must first succeed on a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC to complete the casting. On a failed save, the casting is disrupted, the spell fails, and the spells points or spell slot is wasted.
* Whenever the creature starts its turn while concentrating on a spell, it must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC to maintain concentration. On a failed save, it loses concentration on the spell.

At 11th level, the radius of this feature increases to 30 feet.

### Arcane Sense
Beginning at 7th level, you can use your action to gain the benefits of the detect evil and good spell or the detect magic spell until the end of your next turn.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Arcane Resistance
Starting at 11th level, while the target of your Hunter's Mark spell is within 30 feet of you, you gain the following benefits:
* You have advantage on saving throws against spells they cast.
* You have resistance to damage dealt by spells they cast.

### Inquisitor's Wrath
At 15th level, you can cast the counterspell and dispel magic spells at 3rd level against the target of your Hunter's Mark without expending spell points. If they are within 30 feet of you, you have advantage on the spellcasting ability check for these spells.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to 1 + your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
