# Ranger

This class is entirely redesigned, so all information is provided. You can use the original D&D5e 2014 version, but I definitely suggest looking at this revision based on Star Wars 5e’s Scout.

## Class Features
As a ranger, you gain the following class features.

#### Hit Points
___
- **Hit Dice:** 1d10 per ranger level
- **Hit Points at 1st Level:** 10 + your Constitution modifier
- **Hit Points at Higher Levels:** 1d10 (or 6) + your Constitution modifier per ranger level after 1st

- **Weapons:** simple weapons, martial weapons
- **Tools:** None
___

- *(a)* two shortswords or *(b)* two simple melee weapons
- *(a)* a dungeoneer's pack or *(b)* an explorer's pack
- A longbow and a quiver of 20 arrows

Alternatively, you may start with 5d4 × 10 gp to buy your own equipment.

### Ranger's Quarry
_**Ranger:** 1st, 5th, 9th, and 17th level_<br>
You learn how to effectively read and track your prey. Once on each of your turns, you can choose a creature you can see within 120 feet and mark it as your quarry (no action required). For the next hour, you gain the following benefits:
- Once per turn, when you hit the target with a weapon attack, you can deal 1d4 additional damage to it of the same type as the weapon's damage. This die changes as you gain ranger levels, as shown in the Ranger's Quarry column of the ranger table.
- You have advantage on any Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Survival) check you make to find it while it's on the same planet as you.

You can only have one creature marked in this way at a time. Beginning at 5th level, you can use your reaction to mark a creature when it enters your line of sight, provided it is within range of your Ranger's Quarry.

The duration increases to 8 hours at 9th level and 24 hours at 17th level.

### Pathfinder
_**Ranger:** 1st level_<br>
You are skilled at navigating the untamed wilds. You ignore difficult terrain, and when traveling for an hour or more, you gain the following benefits:
- Difficult terrain doesn't slow your group, provided they can see and hear you.
- You can't become lost by unenhanced means.
- Even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger.
- If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.
- When you forage, you find twice as much food.
- You have advantage on Survival checks.

### Spellcasting
_**Ranger:** 2nd level_<br>
You have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does.

#### Spell Slots
The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your ranger spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.

For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot.

#### Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher
You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list.

The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

<div align="center">

**Spell save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + <br>your Wisdom modifier

**Spell attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + <br>your Wisdom modifier

</div>

#### Spellcasting Focus
2nd-level ranger optional feature

You can use a druidic focus as a spellcasting focus for your ranger spells. A druidic focus might be a sprig of mistletoe or holly, a wand or rod made of yew or another special wood, a staff drawn whole from a living tree, or an object incorporating feathers, fur, bones, and teeth from sacred animals.

### Fighting Style
At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the fighting style options, detailed [HERE](Feats\Fighting Styles and Masteries\index.md).

### Primal Awareness
When you reach 3rd level, you can focus your awareness through the interconnections of nature: you learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class if you don't already know them, as shown in the Primal Awareness Spells table. These spells don't count against the number of ranger spells you know.

#### Primal Awareness Spells
|Ranger Level|Spell
|:--:|:--:|
|3rd|speak with animals|
|5th|beast sense|
|9th|speak with plants|
|13th|locate creature|
|17th|commune with nature|

You can cast each of these spells once without expending a spell slot. Once you cast a spell in this way, you can't do so again until you finish a long rest.

### Ranger Archetype
At 3rd level, you choose an archetype that you strive to emulate from the list of available archetypes. Your choice grants features at 3rd level, and again at 7th, 11th, and 15th level.

### Ability Score Improvement 
_**Ranger:** 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level_<br>
You can increase one ability score by 2, or you can increase two ability scores by 1. You can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.

### Martial Versatility
_**Ranger:** 4th level_<br>
Whenever you reach a level in this class that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature, you can replace your 2nd level fighting style with another fighting style. This replacement represents a shift of focus in your martial practice.

### Extra Attack
_**Ranger:** 5th level_<br>
You can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Expertise
_**Ranger:** 6th and 14th level_<br>
Choose two of your skill proficiencies, or one of skill proficiencies and one of your tool proficiencies, or two of your tool proficiencies. You gain expertise in those skills or tools.

At 14th level, you can choose another two proficiencies (in skills or tools) to gain this benefit.

### Commando 
_**Ranger:** 10th level_<br>
You can take the Dash or Hide actions as a bonus action on each of your turns. Additionally, you can remain perfectly still for long periods of time to set up ambushes. 

When you attempt to hide on your turn, you can opt to not move on that turn. If you avoid moving, creatures that attempt to detect you take a -10 penalty to their Wisdom (Perception) checks until the start of your next turn. You lose this benefit if you move or fall prone, either voluntarily or because of some external effect. You are still automatically detected if any effect or action causes you to no longer be hidden. 

If you are still hidden on your next turn, you can continue to remain motionless and gain this benefit until you are detected.

Finally, you can no longer be tracked by unenhanced means, unless you choose to leave a trail.

### Combat Spells
_**Ranger:** 14th level_<br>
When you use your action to cast a spell, you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action.

### Supreme Awareness 
_**Ranger:** 18th level_<br>
You gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can't see. When you attack a creature you can't see, your inability to see it doesn't impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it. 

You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn't hidden from you and you aren't blinded or deafened.

### Foe Slayer 
_**Ranger:** 20th level_<br>
You become an unparalleled hunter. Your Strength or Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Wisdom score increases by 2. Your maximum for those scores increases by 2.

Additionally, once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied.
