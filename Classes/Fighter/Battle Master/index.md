# Fighter Subclass

## Battle Master (revised)
Those who emulate the archetypal Battle Master employ martial techniques passed down through generations. To a Battle Master, combat is an academic field, sometimes including subjects beyond battle such as weaponsmithing and calligraphy. Not every fighter absorbs the lessons of history, theory, and artistry that are reflected in the Battle Master archetype, but those who do are well-rounded fighters of great skill and knowledge.

### Student of War
At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with one type of artisan's tools of your choice.

### Improved Combat Superiority
When you choose this specialty at 3rd level, your tactical skill in combat improves, granting bonuses to your Combat Superiority.
- You learn two additional maneuvers of your choice, and you earn more at higher levels, as shown in the Battle Master Maneuver Table at the bottom of this page.
- You have two additional superiority dice, and you earn more at higher levels, as shown in the Battle Master Dice Number column of the fighter class table.
- You superiority dice grows more rapidly as you gain fighter levels, as shown in the Dice Size column of the Battle Master Maneuver Table at the bottom of this page.

### Signature Maneuver
At 3rd level, you choose a maneuver that you know as your signature maneuver. Whenever you use that maneuver, you can use a Superiority Dice without expending it.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you complete a short or long rest.

### Know Your Enemy
If you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with another creature outside combat, you can learn certain information about its capabilities compared to your own. The DM tells you if the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to two of the following characteristics of your choice:
- Strength score
- Dexterity score
- Constitution score
- Armor Class
- Current hit points
- Total class levels (if any)
- Fighter class levels (if any)

### Greater Signature Maneuver
At 10th level, you can choose a second signature maneuver.

### Relentless
Starting at 15th level, when you roll initiative and have no superiority dice remaining, you regain 1 superiority die..

### Master of Battle
At 18th level, once per round, if you would roll a superiority die, you can instead take the maximum.
