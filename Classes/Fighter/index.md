# Fighter Changes
The following is changed for all Fighters

## Class Features

### Fighting Style
At 1st level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the fighting style options, detailed [HERE](Feats\Fighting Styles and Masteries\index.md).

### Combat Superiority
At 2nd level, you learn maneuvers that are fueled by special dice called superiority dice.
Maneuvers
- You learn two maneuvers of your choice, which are detailed [HERE](Classes\Fighter\Maneuvers\index.md), and you earn more at higher levels, as shown in the Maneuvers Known column of the Fighter Maneuvers Table. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. 
- You can use only one maneuver per attack, and you may only use each maneuver once per turn.
Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.

#### Superiority Dice
You have one superiority die, which is a d4, and you earn more at higher levels, as shown in the Dice Amount column of the Fighter Maneuvers Table. This die changes as you gain fighter levels, as shown in the Dice Size column of the Fighter Maneuvers Table. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.

#### Saving Throws
Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuverâ€™s effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

<center>

**Maneuver save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)

</center>

### Extra Attack (2) (replacement)
At 11th level, you can attack three times whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. 

**Additionally, when you use a bonus action to engage in Two-Weapon Fighting, you can make two attacks, instead of one.**
