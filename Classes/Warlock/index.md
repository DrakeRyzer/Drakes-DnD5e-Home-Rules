# Warlock Changes

## Class Features

### Pact Magic
#### Spells Known
You know a number of warlock spells equal to your Charisma modifier + half your warlock level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.

## Spellcasting Alternatives
When you take your first level in Warlock, you can choose to keep their main class and casting Ability Score as Charisma. However, using the following rules you can choose to instead change your main class and casting Ability Score to either Intelligence or Wisdom, depending on your patron or how you believe your warlock obtained their powers.

### Intelligence-Based Warlocks
Some patrons, such as the Great Old One, Keeper of the Depths, and Accursed Archive are particularly suited to a more intelligent warlock, but any of them can be suited if you've talked with your DM about how this may be implemented.
 
These rules are designed to enable you to play a warlock that is based on Intelligence as the primary attribute for the class instead of Charisma.
 
Wizards beware - the warlock is entering your domain with secrets once thought forgotten.

#### Saving Throws
Your saving throw proficiencies become Intelligence, Wisdom instead of Charisma, Wisdom when you select this class at 1st level.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Intelligence modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.

#### Class Feature and Invocation Alteration
Whenever a warlock class feature or an Eldritch Invocation references your Charisma modifier, you must use your Intelligence modifier instead of your Charisma modifier.

### Wisdom-based Warlocks
Some patrons, such as the Fey, Storm Lord, Ashen Wolf, Eternal Citadel, Forgotten Graveyard, and Warrior-Saint are particularly well suited for a warlock that relies on Wisdom, but many of them can be suitable if you've talked with your DM about how this may be possible.
 
These rules are designed to enable you to play a warlock that is based on Wisdom instead of Charisma as the primary attribute for the class.

#### Spellcasting Ability
Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
