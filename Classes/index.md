# General Class Changes
All Optional Class features from Tasha's are in play (Such as Monk’s Dedicated Weapon or Rogue’s Steady Aim) as well as the additional features listed below.

## Additional Features
All Classes with Spellcasting get additional Cantrips at 1st-level, based on their casting type.
- Bard, Cleric, Druid, Sorcerer, Warlock, and Wizard get 3 additional Cantrips.
- Artificer, Paladin, and Ranger get 2 additional Cantrips.
- Casting Subclasses for Barbarian, Fighter, Monk, and Rogue get 1 additional Cantrip.
Additionally, whenever you reach a level in a class, you can replace one cantrip you learned from this class’s Spellcasting feature with another cantrip from their respective spell list.

## Fighting Style Features
Rather than specific Fighting Styles per class, you may choose one of the FIghting Styles detailed [HERE](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-OXvHuGUtAm6HuvLB5Hn).

### Martial Versatility
Whenever you reach a level that grants the Ability Score Improvement feature in a class, you can replace the fighting style you know from that class with another fighting style available. This replacement represents a shift of focus in your martial practice.
