# Paladin Subclass

## Oath of Thunder
The Oath of Thunder calls to paladins who wish to harness the primal power of the sky itself. Like a thunder storm that strikes with lightning from above, or a whirlwind of destruction that sucks up everything in its path, a Paladin who adheres to this oath becomes thunder incarnate.

### Tenets of Thunder
A paladin who takes this oath has the tenets of thunder etched deep into their mind.<br>
**Speak like Thunder.** Your voice shall be heard by all.<br>
**Strike like Lightning.** Be swift, be forceful, be strong.<br>
**Conduct Power.** Let your unwavering energy surge into your companions, and transform them into something greater.<br>
**Be the Eye of the Storm.** Be the change you want to see.

### Oath Spells
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.
| Paladin Level | Spells |
|:-------------:|:------:|
| 3rd | Thunderwave, Witch Bolt |
| 5th | Gust of Wind, Shatter |
| 9th | Call Lightning, Thunder Step |
| 13th | Ice Storm, Storm Sphere |
| 17th | Cone of Cold, Destructive Wave |

### Channel Divinity
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.

#### Storm Strike
As an action, you can infuse a ranged or thrown weapon with lightning and make an attack. You create a line of lightning 5 ft wide and 60 ft long that deals 2d10 + your Paladin level in lightning damage on a failed Dexterity save against your Paladin spell DC, or half that on a successful save. The target of the attack roll has disadvantage on the save if the weapon attack hits.

#### Thunder Leap
As an action, you can choose to jump up to your movement speed in any direction. When you land, lightning explodes around you, forcing all creatures in a 5 foot radius to make a Dexterity saving throw against your Paladin spell DC. Those that fail the saving throw are knocked back 5 feet and take 2d10 + your Paladin level in thunder damage. Those that make that succeed on the saving through take half damage and are not knocked back.

### Aura of the Storm
Starting at 7th level, you and friendly creatures within 10 feet of you gain resistance to lightning and thunder damage. In addition, as a bonus action, you can cause a strong wind to whirl around you until you dismiss it (no action required), causing the following effects:
* Unprotected flames, torch-sized or smaller, are extinguished.
* The area counts as difficult terrain. You can choose any number of creatures to be immune to this effect.
* It expels vapour, gas, and fog that can be dispersed by strong wind.

At 18th level, the radius of this aura extends to 30 feet.

### Thunder Struck
Beginning at 15th level, ranged attack rolls are made against you at disadvantage and you are immune to the paralyzed condition.

### Thunder God
At 20th level, as an action, you can mantle the powers of a tempest deity. For 1 minute, your body crackles with thunder and lightning, and your eyes glow blue, revealing the raging storm within. You gain the following benefits:
* You are immune to lightning and thunder damage.
* You have a fly speed of twice your walking speed. While you are flying, you deal 1d8 lightning damage to a hostile creature when you enter its reach, and 1d8 thunder damage when you leave its reach. You can deal this damage to a creature when you enter and leave its reach only once per turn.
* Lightning and thunder damage you deal ignores resistance and creatures with immunity to lightning or thunder damage talk half damage. Creatures cannot benefit from the Lightning Absorption trait from damage you deal.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you complete a long rest.
