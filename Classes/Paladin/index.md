# Paladin Changes

## Class Features

### Lay on Hands
Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool equal to your paladin level Ã— 5 of healing power that replenishes when you take a long rest.

With that pool, you can use the following effects:
- As an action or bonus action, you can touch a creature and draw power from the pool to restore a number of hit points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in your pool. You may also expend a spell slot as part of this action or bonus action to regain 5 points of Lay on Hands per spell level of the spell slot.
- Alternatively, you can expend 5 hit points from your pool of healing to cure the target of one disease or neutralize one poison affecting it. You can cure multiple diseases and neutralize multiple poisons with a single use of Lay on Hands, expending hit points separately for each one.

This feature has no effect on undead and constructs.

### Fighting Style
At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the fighting style options, detailed [HERE](Feats\Fighting Styles and Masteries\index.md).
