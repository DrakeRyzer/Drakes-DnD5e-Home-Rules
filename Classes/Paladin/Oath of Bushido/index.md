# Paladin Subclass

## Oath of Bushido
A paladin who takes this oath swears to uphold justice and honor through compassion and loyalty.

### Tenets of Bushido
**Honesty and Justice.** Be scrupulously honest in your relationships with others and believe in justice that comes not from other people but from yourself. The true samurai has no uncertainty about honesty and justice – for there is only right and wrong.

**Courtesy and Compassion.** You have no reason to be cruel nor show off strength, even to your enemies. Without such an outward show of respect, a man is little more than an animal. The power you wield bears a drive towards the common good.

**Duty and Loyalty.** For you to perform an action or make a statement is to become its owner. The responsibility for what follows falls on you and you alone. And for that to which you bear responsibility and those to which you bear love, you must also bear immense loyalty.

### Oath Spells
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.
| Paladin Level  | Spells |
|:---:|:-----------:|
|  3rd  | compelled duel, zephyr strike |
|  5th  | kinetic jaunt, zone of truth |
|  9th  | crusader's mantle, intellect fortress |
|  13th  | banishment, freedom of movement |
|  17th  | legend lore, steel wind strike |

### Channel Divinity
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following Channel Divinity options.

##### Way of the Warrior: 
As a reaction, when you or an ally you can see within 15 feet of you is forced to make a saving throw against being charmed or frightened by a creature, you assert the courage of a warrior. The targeted creature automatically succeeds on the saving throw, and the creature that triggered the effect must instead make a Wisdom saving throw or become your choice of charmed or frightened of you for one minute. A creature charmed or frightened in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

##### Iaido Strike: 
As a bonus action, you can augment your first strike in combat against a creature you haven't attacked yet. If the first attack you make against that creature hits, it automatically is a critical hit, and the creature takes one additional weapon damage die of damage. 

If the attack misses, you have disadvantage on your next attack roll.

###	Duelist of Honor and Humanity
Starting at 7th level, your skill at one-on-one combat is unmatched. When another creatures damages you with a melee attack, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by 1d10 + your Charisma modifier. If the attack would deal 0 damage after this reduction, you can immediately make one melee attack against that creature. You must be wielding a shield or a simple or martial weapon to use this reaction.

### Unflinching Combatant
By 15th level, your unyielding resolve makes you a bastion of courage. Also, you have advantage on Strength and Dexterity checks made to avoid being grappled or shoved, and checks made to grapple or shove you are made at disadvantage.

Additionally, you have advantage on Strength and Constitution saving throws.

### Peerless Master
At 20th level, you can assume the mantle of a Kensei – a sword saint. You can use your action to gain the following benefits for 10 minutes:

* You have resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, slashing, and one other damage type of your choice.
* Your movement speed increases by 15 feet.
* Allies that start their turn within 10 feet of you gain 10 temporary hit points.
* You gain an additional action on each of your turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack only), Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action.
