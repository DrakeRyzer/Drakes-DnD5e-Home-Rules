# Paladin Subclass

## Oath of the Hunter
While all paladins are true believers, not all are the knights in shining armour with glimmering blades portrayed in legends. Some paladins prefer unconventional tactics and forms.
### *Tenets of the Hunter*
- **Predator:** Be the hunter. Never the hunted.
- **Preparation:** Know your prey. Know how it hunts.
- **Precaution:** Strike from afar. Strike without warning.
- **Precision:** Strike fast. Strike true.

### Oath Spells
You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.
| Paladin Level | Spells |
|:-------------:|:------:|
| 3rd | Ensnaring Strike, Hail of Thorns |
| 5th | Cordon of Arrows, Pass Without Trace |
| 9th | Flame Arrows, Lightning Arrow |
| 13th | Hallucinatory Terrain, Locate Creature |
| 17th | Conjure Volley, Swift Quiver |

### Channel Divinity
When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.

#### Hunter's Blessing
As a bonus action, you can use your Channel Divinity to imbue your ranged weapon attacks with holy power. For the next minute you can use your Divine Smite ability when you hit a creature with a ranged weapon attack.

#### Divine Instinct
As an action you can use your Channel Divinity to identify the telltale signs of your chosen prey. For 1 hour, you add your Charisma modifier to Wisdom (Perception) or Wisdom (Survival) checks you make to find it. Based on tracks and other traces it has left behind, you immediately learn whether the creature has any damage immunities, resistances, or vulnerabilities and what they are. If the creature is hidden from divination magic, you sense that it has no damage immunities, resistances, or vulnerabilities. While pursuing your prey, difficult terrain doesn't slow you or your group's travel.

### Shared Precision
At 7th level, when you hit a creature with a ranged attack, you can use your bonus action to grant your allies within 10 feet of you advantage to hit that target until the start of your next turn. Your allies must remain within 10 feet of you, and must be able both to see and hear you to gain this benefit.

At 18th level, the range of this ability increases to 30 feet.

### Back in the Fight
At 15th level, you are an expert in guiding and advising your companions on how to succeed in the hunt.

You can use your Lay on Hands ability on any creature within 60 feet of you.

In addition, when you heal another creature with your Lay on Hands, you can also choose to grant it an inspiration die, which it can roll and add to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw it makes. The size of this inspiration die depends on how much healing the creature received from your Lay on Hands that round. The die is a d4 and increases by one step for every five points of healing the creature receives.

### Divine Hunter
At 20th level, you engage evil from afar, striking down your foes before they can threaten your allies. As an action, you can manifest incredible speed and precision, gaining the following benefits for 1 minute:
* You have advantage on all ranged attack rolls.
* When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can make one additional attack as part of that action.
* Your ranged weapon attacks score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20.

Once you use this feature, you canâ€™t use it again until you finish a long rest.
