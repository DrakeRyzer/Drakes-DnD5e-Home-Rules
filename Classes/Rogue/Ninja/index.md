# Rogue Subclass

## Ninja
Shinobi of the ninja archetype are masters of utilizing preparation and ingenuity to accomplish miracles of subterfuge, infiltration, and assassination. Through the use of specially developed techniques and technologies, they stalk their foes in cover of darkness, and once they've found them, pacify them without their target often even knowing they were there.

To be an effective ninja is to have the right tools for the job, and these shinobi have more than their fair share.

### The Art of Subterfuge
When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency with your choice of either the disguise kit or poisoner's tools.

Additionally, when you roll for initiative, you can immediately use a reaction to move up to half your speed and take the Hide action. This movement happens before the Initiative order is determined.

### Ninjutsu Arts
Starting at 3rd level, you learn to combine poison, stealth, and deadly tools to perform assassination techniques. 

Whenever you finish a short rest, you can prepare a number of Ninjutsu Arts equal to your proficiency bonus. 

Your save DC for your Ninjutsu Arts is equal to 8 + your Intelligence Modifier + your proficiency bonus.

As a bonus action on your turn, you can use one of your prepared Arts. Each art can only be used once, and you regain all expended uses at the end of a short rest. You can choose from among the following arts, detailed at the end of this class.

### Strike From Shadow
At 9th level, you master the use of your Ninjutsu Arts from the shadows. If you are hidden from a creature when you target it with a Ninjutsu Art, the creature has disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against the Art this turn.

### One with the Dark
At 13th level, your affinity for shadow is unparalleled. As an action while in dim light, darkness, or a heavily obscured area, you can become invisible, along with anything you are wearing or carrying. This invisibility ends early if you enter into the light, deal damage to a creature, or force a creature to make a saving throw.

Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest. While you have no remaining uses of this feature, you can expend one use of your Ninjutsu Arts to use this feature again. When you do so, the maximum number of Ninjutsu Arts you can prepare decreases by 1 until the end of your next long rest.

### Shades of Night
Starting at 17th level, your familiarity with poisons and explosives makes you nearly untouchable. Your Evasion feature now applies to Constitution saving throws as well as Dexterity saving throws.

## Ninjutsu Arts

#### Beguiling Fragrance (Miwaku Kaori):
You attempt to charm a creature you can see within 10 feet of you. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become charmed for one minute. 

A creature charmed in this way regards you and your allies as friendly acquaintances. Creatures that are hostile to you or your companions make the saving throw with advantage. The creature remains charmed for one minute or until you or your allies do anything harmful to it. When the charm ends, the creature knows it was charmed by you.

Additionally, while this art is prepared, you have advantage on saving throws against being charmed.

##### Blinding Firework (Mobaku Hanabi):
You attempt to blind a target you can see within 15 feet of you. The target must make a Constitution saving throw or be blinded for one minute. A creature blinded in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Additionally, while this art is prepared, you have advantage on saving throws against being blinded.

#### Blowgun (Fukiya):
You attempt to knock a target unconscious. You fire a dart at a creature you can see within 30 feet of you. The target takes 1 point of piercing damage and must make a Constitution saving throw or become incapacitated for one minute. A creature incapacitated in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Creatures that are hostile to you or your companions make the saving throw with advantage.

Additionally, while this art is prepared, you cannot be put to sleep by magical means.

#### Caltrops (Makibishi):
You scatter a series of iron stars on the ground. Choose a point you can see within 20 feet of you. The area in a 10-foot square around that point becomes difficult terrain. A creature that enters the area for the first time or moves through it must make a Dexterity saving throw or stop moving and take 1d4 + your Intelligence modifier piercing damage. Until the creature regains at least 1 hit point, its walking speed is reduced by 10 feet.

Additionally, while this art is prepared, you ignore the effects of difficult terrain caused by nonmagical sources as well as your own Makibishi.

#### Clone Technique (Bunshunjutsu):
Two illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space for 1 minute. Until the Art ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it’s impossible to track which image is real. You can use your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.

Each time a creature targets you with an attack roll during the Art’s duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets one of your duplicates. If you have two duplicates, you must roll a 10 or higher to change the attack's target to a duplicate. With one duplicate, you must roll a 13 or higher. A duplicate’s AC is equal to 10 + your Intelligence modifier. If an attack hits a duplicate, it is destroyed. It ignores all other damage. A creature is unaffected if it can’t see or can perceive the effect is an illusion, as with truesight.

Additionally, while this art is prepared, you have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks made to identify illusions.

#### Ensnaring Chains (Kusari-Fundo):
You attempt to restrain a Large or smaller creature you can see within 20 feet of you. The target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target is restrained. At the end of each of its turns, it repeat the saving throw, ending the effect on itself on a success. Alternatively, a creature other than the target can use an action to remove the chains.

Additionally, while this art is prepared, you have advantage on Dexterity checks made to avoid being grappled.

#### Incendiary Grenade (Houroku-Hiya)
You light and toss a small sphere of gunpowder and iron nails at a point you can see within 30 feet. Each creature you can see within 10 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. Roll a number of d6 equal to half your sneak attack dice total (rounded down). A creature takes that much fire damage on a failed save, or half as much on a success.

Additionally, while this art is prepared, you have resistance to fire damage.

#### Smoke Bomb (Kemuri-Dama):
You create a cloud of thick smoke centered on yourself in a 10-foot radius. The area of the smoke is heavily obscured. The smoke persists for 1 minute or until a strong wind disperses it.

Additionally, while this art is prepared, you have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide in dim light, darkness, or obscured areas.

#### Throwing Knife (Kunai):
You throw a roped-dagger at a creature of Large or smaller size you can see within 30 feet of you. If the creature is your size or smaller, you can attempt to pull it towards you. The creature must make a Strength saving throw, being pulled 10 feet towards you on a failure. Alternatively, if the creature is your size or larger, you can pull yourself 10 feet towards it.

Additionally, while this art is prepared, you can climb up walls without needing to make a check.

#### Throwing Stars (Shuriken):
You have a pool of metal stars equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1). When you use this art, you can throw a number of stars up to your maximum at one or more creatures you can see within 30 feet of you. Each star deals 1d4 + 1 piercing damage. 

You can use your Sneak Attack against a target that takes damage from this ability until the end of your next turn even if you don’t have advantage on the attack roll, but not if you have disadvantage on it.

Additionally, while this art is prepared, you cannot be the target of the magic missile spell.

#### Venomous Art (Kodoku):
You attempt to poison a target you can see within 5 feet of you. The target must make a Constitution saving throw or become poisoned for one minute. A creature poisoned in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Additionally, while this art is prepared, you have advantage on saving throws against being poisoned.
