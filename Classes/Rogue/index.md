# Rogue Changes
## Class Features

### Bad Feeling
Starting at 2nd level, you have a wary eye, bordering on paranoia. When you roll for initiative, you can move up to your speed. This movement happens before the initiative order is determined.

Once you’ve used this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a long rest.

### Cunning Strike
Starting at 5th level, you've developed cunning ways to use your Sneak Attack. When you deal Sneak Attack damage, you can add one of the following Cunning Strike effects. Each effect has a die cost, which is the number of Sneak Attack damage dice you must forgo to add the effect. You remove the die before rolling, and the effect occurs immediately after the attack's damage is dealt. For example, if you add the Poison effect, remove 1d6 from the Sneak Attack's damage before rolling.

If a Cunning Strike effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and Proficiency Bonus.

- **Poison (Cost: 1d6):** You add a toxin to your strike, forcing the target to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the Poisoned condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, the Poisoned target repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success. To use this effect, you must have a Poisoner's Kit on your person.
- **Trip (Cost: 1d6):** If the target is Large or smaller, it must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or have the Prone condition.
- **Withdraw (Cost: 1d6):** Immediately after the attack, you move up to half your Speed without provoking Opportunity Attacks.

### Improved Cunning Strike
Starting at 11th level, you can use up to two Cunning Strike effects when you deal Sneak Attack damage, paying the die cost for each effect.

### Devious Strikes
Starting at 14th level, you've practiced new ways to use your Sneak Attack deviously. The following effects are now among your Cunning Strike options.

- **Daze (Cost: 2d6):** The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or on its next turn, it can do only one of the following: move or take an action or a Bonus Action.
- **Knock Out (Cost: 6d6):** The target must succeed on a Constitution saving throw, or it has the Unconscious condition for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. The Unconscious target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
- **Obscure (Cost: 3d6):** The target must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw, or it has the Blinded condition until the end of its next turn.

### Stroke of Luck
At 20th level, you have an uncanny knack for succeeding when you need to. Your Dexterity and Intelligence scores increase by 2. Your maximum for those scores also increases by 2. Additionally, if your attack misses a target within range, you can turn the miss into a hit. Alternatively, if you fail an ability check, you can treat the d20 roll as a 20.

Once you've used this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.
