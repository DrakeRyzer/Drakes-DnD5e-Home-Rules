# Adventuring Rules

## Careful Checks
#### Taking 10
When you spend at least 10 minutes performing an activity that requires an ability check, that check has consequences for failure, and you don’t have disadvantage on the check, you can choose to make that check carefully, colloquially called “taking 10”. If you do so, you treat the check as if you had rolled a 10 on the d20. 

For instance, if you are crafting an item, during resolution you make an Intelligence check with the appropriate tools to determine your d100 Roll Modifier. Instead of rolling the d20, you can make a careful check and take 10, treating the check as if you’d rolled a 10, adding your Intelligence modifier and proficiency bonus, if you are proficient with the tools.

If you would have advantage on the check, you can instead take 15.

If using the Compound Advantage variant rule, if you have superadvantage on a check, you can take 18. If you have hyperadvantage on a check, you can instead take 20.

#### Taking 20
When you have plenty of time, you are faced with no threats or distractions, and the skill being attempted carries no penalties for failure, you can take 20. In other words, eventually you will get a 20 on 1d20 if you roll enough times. Instead of rolling 1d20 for the skill check, just calculate your result as if you had rolled a 20.

Taking 20 means you are trying until you get it right, and it assumes that you fail many times before succeeding. Taking 20 takes twenty times as long as making a single check would take.

Since taking 20 assumes that the character will fail many times before succeeding, if you did attempt to take 20 on a skill that carries penalties for failure, your character would automatically incur those penalties before he or she could complete the task. 

Common uses of “take 20” include athletics to break an obstacle down, investigation to search, or thieves' tools to open a lock.

## Compound Advantage
If you have multiple sources of Advantage and disadvantage on an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw; they no longer cancel each other out to roll normally. Instead, whichever you have more of decides how you roll. If you have 2 sources of Advantage but only one source of Disadvantage, you roll with Advantage.

## Exertion 
### Exert
Once per round, a player can have their character attempt to exert themselves. When the character makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, the character can roll a Hit Die without expending it, adding the result of the die to the roll. 

Alternatively, on their turn, the character can roll a Hit Die without expending it, increasing their speed by 5 x the amount rolled until the end of their turn. If the character has Hit Dice of different sizes, they can choose which Hit Die they use.

The character can wait until after it rolls the d20 before deciding to exert themselves, but must decide before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails.

### Over-Exertion
When a character exerts themselves, they immediately take damage equal to the amount rolled, which can’t be reduced or negated in any way. If this damage would reduce the character to 0 hit points, they don’t immediately fall unconscious. At the end of the current turn, if the character is still at 0 hit points, they fall unconscious and are stable.

## Party Inspiration
Inspiration Points are earned by the whole party. The party can store points up to the number of players in the group. The party earns Inspiration Points for:
* Great roleplaying moments, deep storytelling with dramatic effect, rich detail in describing combat.
* Working together as a team to overcome extraordinary odds, defeating difficult opponents, and progressing the story when it is not openly directed by the DM.
* Creating a dramatic moment important to their character, or contributing to an important scene involving other player characters that advances their development.

The party can spend an Inspiration Point anytime to:
* Increase one player’s Initiative by +10 for one combat
* Remove two failed Death Saves
* Reroll a single damage roll rolled by a player or the DM.
* Reroll one Attack, Saving Throw or Ability check by a player and choose between the two results.
* Have the DM roll twice when rolling on a random effect table and the party chooses one of the possible results.

## Faster rests
#### Breather
A breather is a short period of rest at least 10 minutes long after strenuous activity. During that time you may rest, slake your thirst and hunger, or check on a single wound and bandage it.

During a breather, you may spend one Hit Die for healing.

For every additional 5 minutes you rest for, you may spend an additional Hit Die.

## Bonus Action Consumables
A creature can use its Bonus Action to apply consumable items such as potions to itself. However, using an item on another creature still requires a full Action.
