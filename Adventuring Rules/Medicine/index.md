## Medicine rules (Needs reworking)

### Stabilise
A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you use your action to try to stabilize a dying creature. This requires a successful Wisdom (Medicine) check of **DC 10**.

### First Aid
**Requires Healer's Kit Use**<br>
As a Full-Round Action, you can administer First Aid to an Unconscious or wounded creature. If you succeed on a DC 15 Medicine check, the creature regains a number of Hit Points equal to its Character Level, +1 for every point by which your check exceeds the DC.

If the skill check succeeds, the tended creature cannot benefit from additional First Aid for 24 hours. You can administer First Aid on yourself, but you have disadvantage on your Medicine check.

### Resuscitate
**Proficient Only; Requires Healer's Kit Use**<br>
As an action, you can revive a creature that has just died. To revive the dead creature you must reach it within **1 round + 1 additional round for each successful death save the creature made before dying**, and succeed on a Wisdom (Medicine) check of **DC 30 - 5 for each successful death save the creature made before dying.** If the check succeeds, the creature is unconscious instead of dead. If the check fails, you are unable to revive the creature.

### Diagnose Illness
If you spend one minute examining a creature, you can make a Wisdom (Medicine) to identify a disease or poison affecting them. The DC is determined by the effect in question.

### Treat Disease
**Requires Herbalist's Kit Use**<br>
Treating a diseased creature requires 8 hours. At the end of that time the creature can immediately repeat the saving throw against the effect of the disease. You can also spend another herbalist's kit use and make a Wisdom (Medicine) check against the disease's DC. If the check succeeds, the creature has advantage on its saving throw, and any check you might have to make against contracting the disease from the sick creature is made with advantage. You can treat a creature's disease once every 24 hours. You can treat one creature at a time if untrained, or up to six simultaneously if trained.

### Treat Poison
**Requires Herbalist's Kit Use**<br>
As an action, you can treat a poisoned creature. The creature may immediately repeat the saving throw against the poison and gains resistance against the next instance of damage it deals. You can also spend another herbalist's kit use and make a Wisdom (Medicine) check. If the result equals or exceeds the poison's DC, the creature has advantage on its saving throw.
