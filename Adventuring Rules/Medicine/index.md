## Medicine Items

### Healer's Kit
**5 gp, 3 lb.** This kit is a leather pouch containing bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check.

With a Healer's Kit you can also use the First Aid, Long Term Care and Resuscitate actions.

### Herbalist's Kit
**5 gp, 3 lb.** This kit contains a variety of instruments such as clippers, mortar and pestle, and pouches and vials used by herbalists to create remedies and potions. The kit has ten uses. Proficiency with this kit lets you add your proficiency bonus to any ability checks you make to identify or apply herbs. Also, proficiency with this kit is required to create antitoxin and any potion of healing.

With a Herbalist's Kit you can also use the Treat Poison and Treat Disease actions.

You can refill one use of the Herbalist Kit with a Wisdom (Survival) check gathering herbs from their environment, with the DC based on their availability.

### Surgeon's Kit
**100 gp, 10 lb.** This Kit contains scalpels, scissors, saws, grasping forceps, and vials of alcohol. You must be proficient in Medicine to use a Surgeon's Kit. A Surgeon's Kit lets you use the First Aid action and benefit from advantage to the Wisdom (Medicine) check. Also, you can attempt the Perform Surgery and Resuscitate actions.

A Surgeon's Kit can be refilled with 10 uses for 40 gold.

### Stabilise
A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you use your action to try to stabilize a dying creature. This requires a successful Wisdom (Medicine) check of **DC 15 + 5 for every death save the creature has failed**.

### Diagnose Illness
If you spend one minute examining a creature, you can make a Wisdom (Medicine) to identify a disease or poison affecting them. The DC is determined by the effect in question.

### First Aid
**Requires Healer's Kit Use**<br>
As an action, you can administer first aid to an unconscious or hit creature. If you succeed on a Wisdom (Medicine) check of **DC 5 + 2x the hit points the creature is missing**, the creature regains a number of hit points equal to your proficiency modifier, +1 for every 5 points by which your check result exceeds the DC. Using a Surgeon's kit grants advantage on your skill check. If the skill check succeeds, the tended creature cannot benefit from additional first aid for the treated injury.

You can administer first aid to yourself, but you suffer disadvantage on your Wisdom (Medicine) check.

### Long Term Care 
**Requires Healer's or Herbalist's Kit Use**<br>
If you tend to a creature for 8 consecutive hours, that creature regains hit points equal to its proficiency modifier, in addition to those recovered from natural healing. The creature also benefits from an advantage to its next Constitution saving throw to resist poison or disease, and its injuries are immune to festering. A creature can only benefit from long term care once in a 24-hour period. You can tend to one creature at a time if not proficient, or up to six simultaneously if proficient. You can't give long term care to yourself.

### Perform Surgery
**Proficienct Only; Requires Surgeon's Kit Use**<br>
You can perform surgery to heal a hit creature's lost hit points, or to remove an injury effect. Any of these operations requires at least 1 hour of uninterrupted work, at the end of which time you must make a Wisdom (Medicine) check. If you fail your check the surgery does not yield any benefit (but any resources used are still lost). In addition, if you fail your check by five or more, the creature takes hit damage equal to its proficiency modifier. If this damage reduces the creature to 0 hit points, it dies.

##### Heal hit Damage
You can make a Wisdom (Medicine) check of **DC 10 + 2x the hit points the creature is missing** to perform surgery on a hit creature, healing an amount of damage equal to your proficiency modifier. You can perform surgery on yourself to heal hit damage, but you have disadvantage on your skill check.

#### Remove Injury Effect
You perform surgery on a specific injury effect that a creature has, in orer to remove or lessen the effect. Not all injury effects can be removed by surgery. Ask your DM if this is possible. To remove an injury effect, make a Wisdom (Medicine) check of **DC 30 - 2 for each position below the first the Injury holds in its Lasting Injury table**. The procedure requires 1 hour of uninterrupted work and one use of a Surgeon's Kit for each 5 points of the DC. A creature proficient in Medicine can attempt to Help by spending an additional use of a Surgeon's Kit.

On a success, the injury effect improves. If the injury requires natural healing, it recovers twice as fast. If the Injury requires magical healing of a specific level or higher, magical healing of up to two levels lower achieves the same result. If the Injury effect lists a Constitution check or saving throw, the roll benefits from advantage for the next week.

Once you attempt surgery on a specific injury effect, you cannot attempt it again for one week. You can however attempt surgery on another injury effect on the same creature.

### Resuscitate
**Proficient Only; Requires Healer's Kit Use**<br>
As an action, you can revive a creature that has just died. To revive the dead creature you must reach it within **1 round + 1 additional round for each successful death save the creature made before dying**, and succeed on a Wisdom (Medicine) check of **DC 30 - 5 for each successful death save the creature made before dying.** If the check succeeds, the creature is unconscious instead of dead. If the check fails, you are unable to revive the creature.

### Treat Disease
**Requires Herbalist's Kit Use**<br>
Treating a diseased creature requires 8 hours. At the end of that time the creature can immediately repeat the saving throw against the effect of the disease. You can also spend another herbalist's kit use and make a Wisdom (Medicine) check against the disease's DC. If the check succeeds, the creature has advantage on its saving throw, and any check you might have to make against contracting the disease from the sick creature is made with advantage. You can treat a creature's disease once every 24 hours. You can treat one creature at a time if untrained, or up to six simultaneously if trained.

### Treat Poison
**Requires Herbalist's Kit Use**<br>
As an action, you can treat a poisoned creature. The creature may immediately repeat the saving throw against the poison and gains resistance against the next instance of damage it deals. You can also spend another herbalist's kit use and make a Wisdom (Medicine) check. If the result equals or exceeds the poison's DC, the creature has advantage on its saving throw.
