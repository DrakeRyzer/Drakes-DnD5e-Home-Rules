# Crafting

## Crafting
You can craft nonmagical objects, including adventuring equipment and works of art. You must be proficient with tools related to the object you are trying to create (typically artisan's tools). You might also need access to special materials or locations necessary to create it. For example, someone proficient with smith's tools needs a forge in order to craft a sword or suit of armor.

### Resources and Resolution
In addition to the appropriate tools for the item to be crafted, a character needs raw materials worth half of the item's selling cost.

- To determine how many days it takes to create an item, divide its gold piece cost by 10. A character can complete multiple items in a day if the items' combined cost is 10 gp or lower. 

Items that cost more than 10 gp can be completed over longer periods of time, as long as the work in progress is stored in a safe location.

Multiple characters can combine their efforts. Divide the time needed to create an item by the number of characters working on it. Use your judgment when determining how many characters can collaborate on an item. A particularly tiny item, like a ring, might allow only one or two workers, whereas a large, complex item might allow four or more workers.

A character needs to be proficient with the tools needed to craft an item and have access to the appropriate equipment. Everyone who collaborates needs to have the appropriate tool proficiency. You need to make any judgment calls regarding whether a character has the correct equipment. The following table provides some examples.

|Proficiency|Items|
|:--|:--|
|Alchemist's Supplies   |Acid, alchemist's fire, antitoxin, firearm ammunition, oil, perfume, or soap|
|Herbalism kit          |Antitoxin, potion of healing|
|Leatherworker's tools  |Leather armor, boots|
|Smith's tools          |Armor, weapons|
|Tinker's tools         |Firearms|
|Weaver's tools         |Cloaks, robes|

If all the above requirements are met, the result of the process is an item of the desired sort. A character can sell an item crafted in this way at its listed price.

## Crafting Magic Items
Creating a magic item requires more than just time, effort, and materials. It is a long-term process that involves one or more adventures to track down rare materials and the lore needed to create the item.

Potions of healing and spell scrolls are exceptions to the following rules. For more information, see "Brewing Potions of Healing" later in this section and the "Scribing a Spell Scroll" section, below.

To start with, a character needs a formula for a magic item in order to create it. The formula is like a recipe. It lists the materials needed and steps required to make the item.

An item invariably requires an exotic material to complete it. This material can range from the skin of a yeti to a vial of water taken from a whirlpool on the Elemental Plane of Water. Finding that material should take place as part of an adventure.

The Magic Item Ingredients table suggests the challenge rating of a creature that the characters need to face to acquire the materials for an item. Note that facing a creature does not necessarily mean that the characters must collect items from its corpse. Rather, the creature might guard a location or a resource that the characters need access to.

Magic Item Ingredients
|Item Rarity|CR Range|
|:---|:---|
|Common|1–3|
|Uncommon|4–8|
|Rare|9–12|
|Very rare|13–18|
|Legendary|19+|

If appropriate, pick a monster or a location that is a thematic fit for the item to be crafted. For example, creating mariner's armor might require the essence of a water weird. Crafting a staff of charming might require the cooperation of a specific arcanaloth, who will help only if the characters complete a task for it. Making a staff of power might hinge on acquiring a piece of an ancient stone that was once touched by the god of magic—a stone now guarded by a suspicious androsphinx.

In addition to facing a specific creature, creating an item comes with a gold piece cost covering other materials, tools, and so on, based on the item's rarity. Those values, as well as the time a character needs to work in order to complete the item, are shown on the Magic Item Crafting Time and Cost table. Halve the listed price and creation time for any consumable items.

Magic Item Crafting Time and Cost
|Item Rarity|Days|*Cost*|
|:---|:---|:---|
|Common     |5  |50 gp|
|Uncommon   |10 |200 gp|
|Rare       |10 |2,000 gp|
|Very rare  |25 |20,000 gp|
|Legendary  |50 |100,000 gp|

*Halved for a consumable item like a potion or scroll

To complete a magic item, a character also needs whatever tool proficiency is appropriate, as for crafting a nonmagical object, or proficiency in the Arcana skill.

If all the above requirements are met, the result of the process is a magic item of the desired sort.

#### Crafting
For every hour of downtime you spend crafting using a tool with which you are proficient, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 5 gp, and you must expend raw materials worth half the total market value.

If you have expertise in the tool in question, you can craft one or more items with a total market value not exceeding 10 gp, and you must expend raw materials worth half the total market value.

#### Mundane Items
Mundane items require often require less time to craft than enchanted items. Determine the craft DC and time required to craft a mundane item using the following table:

##### Item Complexity
The complexity categories listed in the table above are defined as follows. Keep in mind that the key to item complexity isn't to rely on an exhaustive list of what items belong to which categories. Instead, these rules provide basic category descriptions and a few examples of sorts of items one might expect to fit each category.

* **Very Simple:** These items are more or less all one piece or one material of simple shape with no moving parts. **Examples:** crowbar, quarterstaff.
* **Simple:** A simple item is largely made of one material, but it requires a more specialized shape.<br>**Examples:** many simple weapons, backpack, most common articles of clothing, simple traps such as pits.
* **Moderate:** Moderate complexity items are characterized by diverse materials or different parts that must be integrated into a whole.<br>**Examples:** Most martial and exotic weapons, bows, shields, locks, simple traps using simple mechanical triggers, acid.
* **Complex:** Complex items have diverse materials, moving parts, different parts, and/or decorative bits.<br>**Examples:** Most types of armour, composite bows, crossbows, most vehicles (excluding large ocean-going vessels), alchemist’s fire, smokesticks, tingertwigs.
* **Very Complex:** These are the most complicated items. They require diverse materials, moving parts, different parts, decorated bits, and/or multiple functions or uses.<br>**Examples:** ocean-going vessels, unusual armors (such as barding), antitoxins, tanglefoot bags, sunrods, thunderstones.

##### Item Complexity, Crafting Times and DCs
| Item Complexity | Crafting Time | Craft DC |
|:---------------:|:-------------:|:--------:|
| Very simple | 4 hours | 10 |
| Simple | 8 hours | 12 |
| Moderate | 16 hours | 14 |
| Complex | 32 hours | 18 |
| Very complex | 64 hours | 26 |

##### Crafting Masterwork Items
A masterwork item has a 50% increase in crafting time and an item-type-dependent increase in cost (1000 gp for a weapon, 1500 gp for a suit of armor or a shield, or 50 gp for masterwork tools). Furthermore, any masterwork item has its craft DC increased by 4.

##### Working with Special Materials
A craftsman working with an unusual material (such as adamantine) faces a 50% increase in crafting time, which stacks with the 50% increase in crafting time associated with masterwork items, when applicable. Also, unusual materials are harder to work with and increase the item's DC:

##### Special Materials Modifiers
| Material | DC Modifier |
|:--------:|:-----------:|
| Adamantine | +6 |
| Darkwood | +2 |
| Dragonhide | +4 |
| Cold iron | +2 |
| Mithril | +4 |
| Alchemical silver | +2 |

##### Using Tools (or Not…)
All crafts require tools to give the best chance of success. If improvised tools are used, the check suffers disadvantage. Masterwork tools provide advantage to the check.

##### Failing a Check
What happens if the check fails? Well, that depends on how badly it failed. When confronted with a failed check, there are up to three possible bad effects:
1. If the check fails, the item is not completed. Invest the full crafting time and try again.
2. If the check fails by 5 or more, half of the raw materials are ruined. Pay half the raw materials cost to replace the ruined materials.
3. If the check fails by 10 or more and you are using alchemist's supplies, your laboratory explodes. Pay to replace it as well as the ruined raw materials (as number 2 above). Also make a DC 10 Dexterity save to avoid 1d6 points of fire damage.

##### Exceptional Check Results
For every 5 points by which the check exceed the item’s DC, the crafting time is halved.
