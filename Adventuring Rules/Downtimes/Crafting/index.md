# Crafting

## Mundane Crafting
A character who has the time, the money, and the needed tools can use downtime to craft armor, weapons, clothing, or other kinds of nonmagical gear.

### Resources and Resolution
In addition to the appropriate tools for the item to be crafted, a character needs raw materials worth half of the item's selling cost. 

To determine how many workweeks it takes to create an item, divide its gold piece cost by 50. A character can complete multiple items in a workweek if the items' combined cost is 50 gp or lower. 

Items that cost more than 50 gp can be completed over longer periods of time, as long as the work in progress is stored in a safe location.

Mundane Crafting Summary
- Raw materials equal to half the item's value.
- 1 Hour per 1 gold of value


Multiple characters can combine their efforts. Divide the time needed to create an item by the number of characters working on it. Use your judgment when determining how many characters can collaborate on an item. A particularly tiny item, like a ring, might allow only one or two workers, whereas a large, complex item might allow four or more workers.

A character needs to be proficient with the tools needed to craft an item and have access to the appropriate equipment. Everyone who collaborates needs to have the appropriate tool proficiency. You need to make any judgment calls regarding whether a character has the correct equipment. The following table provides some examples.

| Proficiency | Items |
|:--|:--|
|Alchemist's Supplies   |Acid, alchemist's fire, antitoxin, firearm ammunition, oil, perfume, or soap|
|Herbalism kit          |Antitoxin, potion of healing|
|Leatherworker's tools  |Leather armor, boots|
|Smith's tools          |Armor, weapons|
|Tinker's tools         |Firearms|
|Weaver's tools         |Cloaks, robes|




## Brewing Potions of Healing
Potions of healing fall into a special category for item crafting, separate from other magic items. A character who has proficiency with the **Herbalism Kit** can create these potions. The times and costs for doing so are summarized on the Potion of Healing Creation table.

Potion of Healing Creation
| Type | Time | Cost |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|Basic Healing      | 8 hours  | 25 gp
|Greater healing    | 45 hours | 100 gp
|Superior healing   | 120 hours| 1,000 gp
|Supreme healing    | 160 hours| 10,000 gp
