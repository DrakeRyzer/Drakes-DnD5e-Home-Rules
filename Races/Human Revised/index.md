# Human Revised

- **Age:** Humans reach adulthood in their late teens and live less than a century.

- **Size:** Humans vary widely in height and build, from barely 5 feet to well over 6 feet tall. Regardless of your position in that range, your size is Medium.

- **Height and Weight:** You may roll for your character's height and weight on the Random Height and Weight table. The roll in the Height Modifier column adds a number (in inches) to the character's base height. To get a weight, multiply the number you rolled for height by the roll in the Weight Modifier column and add the result (in pounds) to the base weight.

#### Random Height and Weight
|Base Height|	Base Weight|	Height Modifier|	Weight Modifier|

|4'8"| 110 lb.|	+2d10|× (2d4) lb.|	

## Traits

- **Size:** Medium

- **Speed:** 30 feet

- **Ability Score Increase:** One ability score of your choice increases by 2, and two other ability scores of your choice increase by 1. Alternatively, four ability scores of your choice each increase by 1.

- **Defiant:** 
Humans are known to be stubborn and often refuse to give up, even against the worst odds. When you or a creature you can see that can see and understand you makes an ability check, attack roll, or saving throw, you can roll a d4 and add it to their roll (no action required). Once you’ve used this feature, you must complete a short or long rest before you can use it again.

- **Versatile Proficiency:** 
You gain proficiency in one skill, one tool and two weapons of your choice.

- **Languages:** You can speak, read, and write Common and one extra language of your choice. Humans typically learn the languages of other peoples they deal with, including obscure dialects. They are fond of sprinkling their speech with words borrowed from other tongues: Orc curses, Elvish musical expressions, Dwarvish military phrases, and so on.
