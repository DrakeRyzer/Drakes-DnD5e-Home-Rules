# Races of Forgotten Realms
The races listed below are all found in The Forgotten Realms setting. If you want to play a race not found here, please talk to me about it. There are also Revised and Homebrew races listed here that improve upon the vanilla race (namely Human)

Additionally, we are using the Tasha's "Lineage" ruling for Ability Scores. This means you can Choose +2 to any stat and +1 to another stat or +1 to three different stats. This does not affect Human
